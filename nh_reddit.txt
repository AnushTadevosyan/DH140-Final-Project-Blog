This is one of the most safe states in the country. Also, take a look at the FBI murder stats. Most POC are killed by other POC. NH is mostly white so it is entirely possible you will be safer here than in a more “diverse” area:

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls

Now if you’re one of those people who thinks someone asking “where are you from?” is violence then you’ll have a rough time here, but otherwise you’ll be fine. Get a gun and take advantage of constitutional carry if you want an extra layer of protection just in case.

Roughly New Hampshire has about the same crime rate as Australia.

As a POC in the general southern NH region while I’ve never felt very unsafe, I do feel I have to be mindful where I go when I go. You stick out very obviously. Some people have on occasion gave me or my family stares/ looks. So if you’re used to being the only POC in a sea of white people you may feel fine. If not it can be a tad jarring. Overall, people mind their business, and do their own thing. If anything, you’ll experience a lot of micro aggressions.

New Hampshire is one of the most safe states in the country. There is virtually no violent crime. Lock you doors, sure, but nobody will ever try to break in. I think we just recently got beat out by Maine, but overall, we are oober safe.

It is safe. Expect some racial ignorance. If you are settling in the college areas, it is not so bad. People keep to themselves in the rural areas and can feel unwelcoming to new folks. However, they will be the first to help you out when your car is stuck in the winter.

I'm always surprised when I see a minority when I'm out hiking or something further north but I never have any negative thoughts about them. It's just not that common around here

I was nervous about moving here. Especially when you hear how some of the stuff Massachusetts people say, but I haven't had a problem in 11 years. I've actually gotten free drinks at bars because I'm the only brown person there which is weird, but funny.

Some of the northern towns feel a little sketchy, but my experience has been positive.

Getting my hair done has been a little struggle. 😂

Yeah, that is weird. I didn't even know this was a thing. I mean, I've heard of free drinks on ladies night but..

I wonder about the implications of such a gesture.

You won’t face any aggressive discrimination but you’ll definitely feel it under the surface in certain areas or certain types of people in NH.

People confuse New Hampshire residents’ mentality of closing off from others as standoffishness. That can also be misinterpreted as intolerance and plenty of other things.

Truly, we don’t care what other people are up to as long as they don’t make waves that rock our boats. Like when people come from out of state and start messing with local government.

The last part has little to do with your main point, just some friendly advice for anyone from any state that wants to come here lol

As a minority I'll say yes. They'll be nice to your face, but talk about you when you're not around. They like to blame Dominicans from Methuen for all their troubles. Its not the worst here just very casually racist.

If you stay south of Concord you should be fine. NH is generally a very tolerant place where people just let others live their lives the way they see fit. Nashua and Manchester are decently diverse (from NH standards) and the state is becoming more diverse each year.

If you’re a kind hearted person and show respect for others and don’t get nosy in other people’s business, you’ll have no issues here.

The Lakes Region and Great North Woods are known to have some racist pockets so be careful in those areas. Otherwise, welcome!

And even out in the areas more racist inclined, you’re not gonna get raped in the supermarket or have your window blown out by buckshot. There are some racist cunts who might look at you shitty, or say some dumbass racist remarks, but I (and if someone has alternative evidence proving me wrong please show it) haven’t heard of actual physical attacks based on race, creed or religion in NH anytime recently. Hell, you’re more likely to be jumped for being white in certain parts of manch then attacked for being brown in the country side.

Edit: maybe not attacked for being white, but at least targeted as a possible worthwhile mugging for being white.

I agree that physical attacks are unlikely but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a risk. Remember that black kid in Claremont (I think) that was nearly lynched at school? Those kids had to have learned that garbage from someone… Just one example of many.

Speaking subjectively as a white dude. The worst I've heard about was a couple black friends of mine having the N-word yelled at them by certain white trash yokels in Claremont a decade or so ago. Said yokels were mostly uneducated shit people and cowards who won't actually do anything. They're only brave enough to yell stupid shit at people who are on foot as they pass in their vehicle. Same kind who make fun of developmentally delayed/disabled people and probably huff glue. I haven't heard anything about them lately; probably in jail or died from ODing.

Overall I've seen racial diversity increasing in the Upper Valley area a lot since I was a kid. A local white supremacist who was trying to agitate and recruit was shot dead in a very public area there a few years ago and nobody's talking, no culprit found, so you can take that as a positive recommendation I guess.

Really though, you're probably best off specifically asking people from here who are specifically in your ethnic group or similar, and that's likely to give you a more accurate picture of what it's like.

Yeah you'll be safe, hard to say though with the white nationalists picketing right in Kittery.

I have a few course POC friends who've all shared a similar experience. Most racism here is systemic, habit almost. When you're one of the whitest states in the nation, you just inevitably won't know many people of color, especially so the older gens.

So while you won't get attacked, or yelled at, you'll just get a lot of double takes, where someone scanned their surroundings, noticed you weren't white, look back and observe to try and decipher threat.

It's not great. It's very baked in around here. But most of those people don't realize they do it, and will talk and be friendly in person

If you are an educated, polite, respectful person, you will almost certainly be treated fine. If you are an ignorant, boorish oaf, you will probably be treated like one.

Most people don't care if you are a minority but NH Democrats will occasionally post things telling people to move back to Africa so your mileage may vary.

Honestly, NH people don’t care about divisive labels one way or the other, as long as you’re not a jerk you’re fine. But if you miss racism jerks, Boston’s a short drive away.

Interesting to read some of others' experiences. I don't even live in NH, I'm actually from Boston, but my girlfriend is in Manchester. I have limited exposure to there, but from the few times I've been, I've had a guy make a racist remark (claiming I looked "dirty") to me because I was Asian at the supermarket. Astonishingly, had a white child blatantly point at my girlfriend and ask his mom "what is that??" as well, mind you same day same supermarket. Don't be surprised if you get looks and stares from people just for existing, I cannot even eat at a restaurant without seeing the eyes of others just fall on me. If they don't directly say something to you, it's the indirect energy. Definitely an underlying unwelcomeness, and you WILL feel that presence. POC will understand what I'm talking about.
