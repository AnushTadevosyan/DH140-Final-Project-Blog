Had mine broken 3 times last year.

Was half entertaining the idea of just putting a plexiglass sheet up instead of a window.

grew up here and it's still hella safer in all ways from the 80's and 90's. That said some things have gotten worse since covid but don't think in the big picture its all that bad. For a long time DC felt super safe always and that was never the case. People need to be aware of their surroundings at all times and many of us forgot that. I don't think every DC thread needs to devolve into how bad crime is now, but some situational awareness goes a long way. You can still enjoy this wonderful city we live in, just take basic precautions and can reduce the likelihood of being a victim. Be alert and aware your surroundings always. Trust your gut if something feels off get somewhere safer right away. don't sleep on the metro with your phone out and ear buds in your ears... basic stuff goes a long way.

Yeah, I spent the second half of my childhood here after moving from Chicago, and while my part of the south side wasn’t all the stuff you’d usually hear on Fox News, isn’t wasn’t a cakewalk either. Growing up here though? I was actually allowed to walk to the train and catch the bus by myself on the way to school lol. I generally only had to worry about other people my age, not adults running up on me. And that was back when I would tell people I live in DC and they would think I said Cleveland or STL. Now? It’s way better. I’m honestly more concerned about certain anti-social, just for the heck of it behaviors like shoplifting, fare-evasion, loud phone/music on metro, etc than violent crime. Everything you said from people need to be more aware of their surrounds on down I definitely agree with

I've literally never been hassled. Grew up here in the 90s and DC is about the same, if not much safer. I don't see how "I feel unsafe" is a valid argument. Turn off notifications from the news outlets that make their money from scaremongering and go about your day. The only thing that's gotten worse about DC is transplants gentrifying the city and then complaining when it's not as "safe" as their white-majority hometowns.

The analogy with the 90s is tiring tho. Yes it’s not as bad as the 90s but it doesnt mean we should be super happy about the situation either. That something is less bad than complete crap doesnt mean it’s good either and mission is accomplished. Most DC folks didnt live through the 90s and they see what they are faced with now

That wasn't their point. They're saying that DC has consistently been getting safer for the past ~25 years, which it has in terms of both overall violent crime and ward-by-ward violent crime. The myth that "violent crime is spilling over into traditionally safe neighborhoods" is just that, a myth.



The comparison to the 90s is to show that these neighborhoods are not "traditionally safe," they are "traditionally violent," and many transplants don't understand that they're renting a luxury apartment for $30/sqft and shopping at Whole Foods in what was, only a few short years before they arrived, an epicenter of violent crime.

I disagree with DC becoming safer. WaPo last year reported the # of homicides was back to 2003 levels… That there was improvement until the mid-2010s is true. That DC is slipping back in the last 5-7 years is also apparently true according to WaPo

2022 isn't over yet, but overall crime in DC decreased 41% between 2016-2021:

2016 / 2017 crime statistics

2021 / 2022 crime statistics

Over that same 5-year period, crime decreased in every category except homicide, which increased from 129 deaths in 2016 to 160 in 2021.

Despite the decrease in actual crime, perception of crime has increased over the past few years, due to 3 factors:

An increase in actual crime rates for homicides, and (depending on what cities and years you compare) a leveling-off or slight uptick in car thefts and aggravated assault.

Sensationalized and often incorrect reporting on #1, which leads people to believe that there's a crime crisis even when overall crime has significantly decreased.

Most importantly: A major increase in homelessness and visible poverty. You see people in crisis and feel like society's falling apart, because in a real way, it is.

We can't fix #3 with more police and jails, even though it's the primary reason people are feeling unsafe:

I have lived in the same ‘gentrifying’ neighborhood since 2014. So my experience can’t be explained away by saying the rich areas are the only ones feeling this.

When I first moved here, there was a lot of property crime, prostitution, and back alley drug sales. In the last 2 years there has been more violent crime - murders and shootings on my block that didn’t happen before 2020. Armed robberies of nearby stores that didn’t happen before. Police warrant searches of neighbors’ houses looking for violent criminals. Kids shooting in the street just because. Too many armed carjackings (by teenagers) to keep track of. Car thieves crashing into buildings. And more arrogant property crime including break ins while people are home.

I personally feel ‘ok’ walking around still, but I’m aware that at any moment a tense situation could turn into a shooting or stabbing in a way that it never seemed to before. It used to just be yelling and posturing. It’s like we’re all stressed out and collectively lost our minds.

Thanks for sharing. Do you mind telling me what general area you live in? I’m in Shaw. I’ve only lived here for a year and can say I’ve never actually seen anything happen in front of me. I’ve seen the aftermath of 3 shootings in one year.

I walk everywhere in my neighborhood at all hours and haven’t personally seen anything besides people smoking weed, maybe a few arguments.

If I legit saw kids in the street shooting guns randomly I would def feel unsafe. That sounds … incredibly wild. I have friends who live near Trinidad and they def see fucked up stuff but it doesn’t seem to affect them.

For me- I’m see more crime, but that crime isn’t happening to me. Meaning, a person will casually grab a bunch of items from the CVS and just walk out, a person in the giant self-checkout, will ring up 5 thinks in an entire basket, I walk out to see a car on blocks, with tires missing, cars without plates at all, drug deals where they don’t even duck down an alley. The crime has always been there but it seems more brazen.

A lot of people try and start discussion about crime by sharing statistics/articles from outlets that, for mostly political reasons, will always try and paint cities as crime ridden hellholes no matter what the reality is. I grew out just outside New York during the days that are now described as when NYC was safer (i.e., stop and frisk) and I remember with absolute certainty that certain outlets (aka the New York Post) were still describing NYC like it was a literal warzone then as well.

It seems borderline impossible to have a nuanced conversation on crime, period, especially when people of some beliefs have ulterior motives to exaggerate.

Further, we also get to listen to people whine about "defunding the police" which basically never actually happened and amounted to cops being upset because people are mean to them, instead of people having any productive conversations on why so many people have awful experiences with the police being completely useless.

It's also a simple fact that a fair amount posts here (which are often, appropriately, removed by the mods quickly) come from people who don't live in DC or the area or have any actual business here or concern for DC, they're just stirring shit up, probably for the same genre of reasoning that papers like the NY Post have.

It's never just one thing.

I agree so much with this.

It can be difficult to parse out people who genuinely feel unsafe for valid reasons, from people who want to fear-monger and demonize cities for political reasons, from people who feel unsafe because they read Killmoe News on Twitter all day, from people who experience aggressive mentally ill street people and conflate that with “crime getting out of control”, etc etc etc.

Assertions that DC is “unsafe, period” are false and damaging and usually perpetuated by people who have either never personally experienced crime at all, might not live in DC, or have an agenda against DC/“liberal cities”.

Further complicating the issue is the divide on how we ought to deal with crime vs how DC actually deals with crime; how white liberals believe they ought to advocate for POC/equity/ social justice vs. what POC living in DC actually want/believe (also, not a monolith), etc etc etc.

I’m a white liberal, most Black people I talk with who live EOTR actually do want more police and more accountability because they are by far more likely to be victimized. But they also want police accountability and guarantees that police won’t also victimize them.

Lived her for 20 years, not a scared cat by any means. It's not about crime it's about feeling unsafe. And I know this is going to be an extremely unpopular comment but a big part of the problem in Dupont where I live and work is the homeless and the encampments. I don't mind them being there, nor do I mind being asked for money, but being aggressively pursued, having individuals stand behind me at the ATM screaming at me for money, being called names this makes people feel unsafe.

Genuinely wondering, why do you not mind the encampments when they are the source of your feelings of unsafe?

Personally, I don’t think encampments belong in a city. They absolutely cannot be a normal part of city living. They are a complete failure of society to actually address a problem.

Most of the problematic stuff I witness in the city happens exclusively in encampments (drugs, threats, catcalling, antisocial behavior, theft, etc.)

IMO this is part of the reason these problems never get addressed. How can we make things feel safer if we accept the things that make us feel unsafe?

If the people in the encampments are not bothering anyone (meaning harassing etc) then they don’t bother me. Just their mere existence to me is not a problem If they could just do that, the encampments. I agree the City needs to do something to address them but that is primarily for the sake of the homeless people living in them and would support measures to address removal so long as there is some alternative offered. Otherwise they are just going to show up somewhere else. I just read that 80% of DC residents also support this. The problem though from my friends that work with homeless is that the help that is offered is often not accepted. If we are going to rid the City of encampments we have to offer a solution that will help solve The problem. I don’t know the solution, I wish I did.

Yep. Even in terms of a productive policy conversation (which of course is rare or impossible), I'm always intrigued by how common it is to hear people complaining about BLM or the "Defund the Police" movement (which again, hardly happened) rather than people pointing out "hey, why do we give police departments billions of dollars for them to mostly do nothing and just protect their own and selectively enforce the law?"

Guess it shows you the grasp that police unions and the police in general have on the media. Also look at how quickly news stations (especially local news) parrots whatever talking points police give them with no regard for the truth or whether it's PR spin from the cops.

Same. I do admit that I kind of understand/agree with the talking point that the Defund movement had poor messaging...because personally, I'm not even saying we need fewer cops. But aside from more accountability, even if we want to fund more mental health outreach/services, well, has anyone seen a major police budget recently? There is an astronomical amount of waste and money going towards tools of war which really aren't needed.

It's funny, because think of how many problems stem from not being able to trust police - in some hypothetical world where we can say with 100% certainty that all cops are honest and good, then sure, why not have cops on every street corner and laws like stop and frisk, and strict enforcement of shit like fare hoppers on the metro? Problem is, we can't, and we know exactly what that stuff leads to.

Yeah, I was close to some of the people who were at or near the center of DC's Defund orgs and all of their messaging was pretty close to what /u/21coozapalooza said, so it's funny that their messaging is being described as off. At core they were certainly vehement about working towards the abolition of the police, but the actual messaging they led with was along the lines of "cops as a safety tool don't work, and, from their own reporting, actually seem to have some pretty consistent negative effects on the communities they are in. We need to defund police and fund our social services."

In the face of that, like you are saying, the media coverage I saw Defund getting was either always coming out of a cop, a cop mouthpiece, or a cop-aligned politician or, on the rarer occasion that someone was talking to a neutral expert or, god-forbid, someone critical of the police, they would always have another cop mouthpiece giving the opposing argument "to keep things fair and unbiased."

Having heard the internal discussions secondhand, talked to Defund organizers, and seen the social media and other messaging campaigns they were putting out, and having seen media discussions of Defund, I might argue that most people have never even really heard what any of the Defund groups were saying firsthand. Activist groups just don't have the money or media access that cops do.

Cops don't prevent crime. They show up after a crime has occurred, that's just the nature of things. You can't predict crime or make cops omniscient so that they're always in the right place at the right time, so I don't see how more cops would solve anything.

I think the problem is "Build it and they will come ".

The places people new to the city mention are Eckington, Hill City, Bladensburg Rd and other areas that were off limit for a reason.

These areas have always had crime. Those of us who live in Dupont + Adam's Morgan + Georgetown + Connecticut Ave don't experience the same level of crime .

I travel to the US a lot from the UK for work (was in DC earlier this year and coming back in Feb!). I love your country so much, there's nowhere else you could spark up an in-depth conversation with someone while waiting for a coffee.

One difference I've noted is that you all are so much more ok with living and dealing with violent crime. I follow a few threads (I tend to follow those in cities I visit e.g. dc and Chicago- its great to find local knowledge). I've been to the US about 15 times in the last 18 months.

You're the most approachable, outgoing people you could meet. It's OK to gripe sometimes ( we love to moan here). I see people talking on here about "this is a great area, lots of parks but someone was shot on the corner last week". Why shouldn't someone have issue with that.

Anyway I'm not coming from a place to expect you to listen to my opinion and I can't judge (we have crime ) but I can't help notice how nonchalant you are over violent crime. I kinda respect it because I'm frightened by that stuff but I see this a lot

I think part of it is unfortunately because the US as a whole is overrun with guns. And it’s not something that any individual area can fix. If DC really cracks down on letting people have guns, they’ll just come in from neighboring states because the US is so, so, so saturated with guns. Until we repeal the Second Ammendment and start a nationwide crackdown, I don’t think anything will change in terms of this culture that views violent crime as a basic aspect of living in a city.

Both of these things can be true:

1-DC is a great place to live.

2-Violent crime is a major problem.

I have also lived in DC for almost 15 years and I think this is the worst it has been regarding crime. When I first moved here and lived in a very sketchy neighborhood, crime was definitely an issue but you felt like things were slowly getting better each year. Today, I think we are back sliding big time and things will likely get worse before they get better.

What exactly do you mean by "being shut down?" Are you saying you are actively being censored on this platform or others? Or are you saying you voiced your opinion and someone else told you they think you're wrong? If that's the case that's not "being shut down," that's simply someone offering their opinion just like you did.

If it's the latter (as I highly suspect it is) then it's probably because just like in this very post, all you are offering is "feels" and "anecdotes." You even acknowledge media frenzy plays a part but apparently refuse to believe any conclusion other than what things "feel like" to you and your friends.

Here's the thing, crime is absolutely up, that's undeniable. But so is the media hysteria and with that the instances of people using this subreddit like their personal Facebook page describing every single thing that made them nervous have absolutely skyrocketed. Of course you "feel" less safe, you're being bombarded with media that tells you so every day.

But here's the reality - carjackings, that crime everyone is shitting their pants over in this subreddit, went from 360 in 2020 to 426 in 2021. Yep, that a big percentage increase that looks really scary in a tweet or headline, but the increase represents 0.018% of vehicles registered in the District alone, and around 0.009% of the average number of vehicles on DC streets every day. And that doesn't even take into account the fact that carjackings are often skewed towards certain vehicle types/values.

So even assuming all carjackings are completely random and only ever target cars registered in DC, you're looking at a roughly 1 in 320,000 chance of being carjacked on any given day, which means you could drive every single day in DC for about 875 years before statistically you're due for a carjacking. In 2020, before the scary scary percentage increase, you could expect to drive for about 975 years before being carjacked, which of course is a longer period, but either way you're looking at several lifetimes worth of driving. Is it really rational to feel like you're significantly less safe from carjackings when you've only gone from one astronomical unlikeliness to another?

And you can do the same thing with other crimes. Murder is super scary and it's up too, right? Well, sure it is, but when you look at the actual stats it gets a whole lot less scary for your average Redditor. More than 90% of murder victims in DC are black males, 86% of murder victims in DC have been previously incarcerated, and both murder suspects and victims in DC have been arrested an average of 11 times before they killed or were killed. Now this certainly doesn't mean these killings are OK, that they're not a serious problem in DC, or that they don't have a profound effect on the victims, their families, and their communities, but strictly from a standpoint of whether the average redditor who presumably is not in a crew and has not been arrested anywhere near 11 times, it means your chances of being murdered were essentially nil before the "murder spike" and remain essentially nil after it.

It's entirely understandable you'd feel less safe when every form of media you consume is telling you murders are up, but again, when you look at the actual data the actual chances of a law-abiding, productive citizen being murdered is so incredibly low as to not even be worth thinking about.

I've said all of this before many times on this subreddit and I'm sure I'll say it again, and I can't wait for the inevitable flood of inbox replies saying "well why don't you tell those statistics to [this one outlier who died]" as if that changes anything about the actual statistics. Sure, a handful of people die from shark attacks or vending machine accidents every year and you can point to those all you want, but it doesn't mean swimming at the beach or buying a soda is inherently unsafe.

TLDR: People are telling you to stop equating feeling less safe with being less safe because despite a tiny statistical uptick your actual risk is so small as to be negligible.

It’s down compared to last year, up from the historic pre pandemic lows. Not even close to what it was on the 90s.

https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance

Also the population has grown quite a bit over the past 15 years and that can explain a big part of the rise by just being more people. All in all it’s up a little bit trending down now.

Thank you!!! I live just north of Columbia Heights proper, but I still feel generally safe in my area. Do I walk around 14th St at night alone? No. But even the handful of shootings or stabbing in the broad area are almost certainly targeted or the people know each other. Basic street smarts and the reality of who is often the victim of crime help in not feeling uneasy every time I leave my apartment.

As a relatively new resident of Columbia Heights who was robbed off 14th street coming home from work late at night last week, I hope we can eventually get to a point where it isn’t unsafe to walk around late at night. The majority of people I see on my commute home are typically other service industry workers who don’t exactly have the choice of not walking around 14th St at night alone. I know that I’m extremely unlikely to be the victim of another crime, however it’s still difficult to feel as safe as I did prior. I love the area and am planning to stay, but I’m not sure what I personally can do to feel safer outside of quitting my job.

Thank you for your comment. The hubris of some people- "oh, just don't walk around your own neighborhood at night! Just work from home! Move!" Like it's that easy for everyone.

Nah, this was what needed to be said.

Someone's personal "feelings" about crime don't reflect reality. Especially when it seems like half the people complaining about the crime spikes haven't experienced anything that even impacted them, they just put themselves in an echo chamber of reddit posts and news reports about how bad it supposedly is.

Nobody is diminishing the experiences of people who have been victimized in some way.

I don’t know what OP was referring to, and I don’t have any recent gripes about this personally, but it does remind me of that recent thread that got a lot of traction arguing that crime discussions should be censored and/or moved to a less prominent subreddit. That caused me to raise an eyebrow, but nothing has actually changed and so I don’t know who is being shut down here if they make a nuanced argument.

Considering the massive cost of living increases and gentrification this is not suprising.

Not to mention the prominence of DC has gained compared to other cities. In the 80s and 90s Baltimore used to be a bigger city with more job opportunities. Now it's the opposite.

Oh for sure. That’s a really good way of looking at it!

I was always wondering about Baltimore myself. The city had a great layout. Horrible public transportation compared to DC. I suspected the lack of public transportation kept poverty in certain areas. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I see what you mean about Job opportunities, now that I think about it Baltimore kind of reminds me of Detroit now a bit!

Yet another almost 15-year resident. I stay quiet on this topic because I'm aware of how little I know. I used to go downtown daily for work but now I work from home full-time. So I see a lot less of every neighborhood, except my own, which doesn't seem significantly changed.

Crime posts are annoying because everybody is parroting talking points and have absolutely no data or evidence to back up the claims. At this point they're just hotbeds of misinformation. The people who post about crimes that happen to them usually have not reported the crime. If the police didn't take the report they don't say what reason they were given. If the crime was not prosecuted there's no statement on if the evidence gathered was any good. It's Bowser's fault for not trying hard enough. It's the police's fault for being lazy. It's the community's fault for not cooperating. All whining, no evidence, no solutions.

Now we've entered the meta phase of complaining about the complaining about crime complaints. And here I am complaining about that. What a waste of time

The problem you're experiencing here is that everyone has an agenda, and they'll assume you have one too, and to be perfectly candid most of the people posting about crime in DC or how dangerous the city has gotten are either being misled by clickbait or outright spreading misinformation.



Just for context: I grew up here in the 80s and 90s, left for college, lived in the burbs for a bit, and came back in the early 2010's. Those of us who remember the late 80s/early 90s in DC have a perspective on crime that transplants often can't relate to. For example, the murder rate rose like 14% from 2020 to 2021, but it was still half of what it was every year during my childhood. Murder isn't the only crime, to be sure, but violent crime in general is less than 1/3 of what it was when I was young. Also, it's important to keep in mind that the population was significantly lower than it is today, so the per capita numbers were even higher.



I don't say this to be like, "Well it was worse in my day, so you don't have a right to complain." I'm bringing it up because context matters. The context here is that DC is an incredibly safe city by virtually any standard one would use. The fact that we went from the murder capital of nation to not even in the top 20 for violent crime is astounding. You're going to get pushback for bringing up "how dangerous DC is" because quite frankly it isn't dangerous, and many of the people who grew up here remember when it was.

I've been here for under 2 years and already got punched by a homeless man, threatened by a couple others, witnessed multiple drug deals in broad daylight, almost got run over more than a few times, and heard a lot of racist slurs and comments and threats (from/towards multiple races)... I don't know what is considered "safe" in the rest of the US, but in my personal experience, this city is not one of the best places that I've lived in.

I can say that what New-Acadia-6496 experienced happens often in large swaths of the city east of 16th ST NW.

Petworth, Shaw, Columbia Heights, H St, Capitol Hill, etc.

Stats are juked and you also have crimes downgraded or not filed (Detective once tried to question if I was punched during a robbery....you know, to dissuade me from filing an assault crime report).

Good luck. Every time I mention crime in DC, the herd gathers around and downvotes me and anyone else who points out the exact things you did to someone about about the safety of neighborhoods around the city. Of course, then there are multiple posts before and after the one in commenting on taking about how their bike or car was stolen, someone assaulted them, she got exposed and touched themselves on the Metro, etc...... but I'm the bad guy for pointing it out to someone moving here and asking a question.

This subreddit almost exclusively talks about crime in vague, anecdotal terms.

I empathize with the victims of crime in the city, but this subreddit is basically a venting outlet for folks who have experienced/witnessed/heard about crime. I’m stunned that anyone feels like they’re not able to express their apprehension about crime in the city - that’s basically what the entire subreddit is.

It also attracts a lot of people who live at least 30 miles away chiming in with their impression of DC that is more informed by what someone told them 20 years ago than what they've actually experienced. It is legit hilarious after awhile to see the same people post in the crime posts, and only in the crime posts. Frederick MD just must not have much going on in it.

Anecdotal evidence is evidence, but it’s not sufficient evidence to make a claim about an entire city.

Crime overall has been steadily decreasing decade by decade in DC, this is simply a fact. I’m not denying that you may feel less safe, but our feels don’t always conform with reality.

What happens when a nations economy is crumbling, while a small, select few are hoarding what wealth is available, forcing everyone else to scrounge for a god damn livable wage?

Covid might have been a factor, albeit a small one, because it's Capitalism that has been leading us to this. The very same thing is happening more in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Atlanta, etc. because everyone is fucking sick and tired of the horseshit magic line that depicts one of the worst economic philosophies in existence.



We are at this point because the rich have forced us here. We could have been so much more, but it was the rich afraid of the loss of their financial hold of the country while fear mongering everyone in to believing Socialism or any other 'left wing' viewpoint is a scam and totalitarian, thus generating the vitriol of conservatives. Now everyone sits here questioning how we can handle all of these problems? How about strong safety nets available to ALL people in the country like M4A and no college tuition? We could be experiencing the same thing that 32 of the other developed nations in the world get to experience, but not the U.S.



No. We'd rather point total blame at kids involved in gangs if you're a liberal or liberals if you're conservative, but they are a symptom of the disease much like the blame game we've been experiencing since the founding of this country.



Good luck everyone, things are going to get incredibly hairy for a while.

Recently, I went clubbing with some friends in Downtown and we got out at, like, 2 AM. One of my drunken friends was starving so we walked to a McDonald’s.

Along the way, this black dude in sweats and a ball cap intersects with us and randomly starts talking with us about Lil Nas (???) which gets one of my friends going and they exchange for a minute. Eventually we’re nearing a Wawa and he goes “I’m gonna grab me a few lemonades. Probably just gonna grab and go, they won’t do shit. I could throw a Molotov cocktail through that window and they wouldn’t do shit to me.”

Just gave me a glimpse into what people are thinking.

The problem is people voted for liberal policies that seemed good on paper and few are willing to question the results of these policies and their effects. Crime is higher, period. People will point to some stats but they’re misleading because there are fewer cops there are fewer reported cases. The stats that matter, which are always reported is homicides. 2011-2012 the city had a 20 year decline in homicides into ~85 per year. Since that low point DC has enacted policies that have resulted in homicides increasing past 200 annually. Some macro effects like Covid are at play but the trend and the causes were well underway before Covid.

Here are a few well meaning but ultimately disastrous policies enacted since 2012: -youth incarceration for felony offenses severely curtailed, this has enabled major felonies, grand theft auto/murder to having nearly no consequence. -the partial legalization of marijuana. (Not entirely DCs fault because they weren’t able to enact full legalization because of republicans in congress). Has permitted a large scale “grey” drug market where weed is not legal enough to tax and monitor effectively “legalizing” illegal drug dealing. Turning the city into the regions drug center. Along with this policy was police no longer being able to use the smell of marijuana as cause for search. -loitering is no longer illegal. So groups of people can legally post up on corners and (see above) hang out but also conduct illegal activity -early release of prisoners. Obviously well intentioned but without social support systems, jobs programs and amidst increased lawlessness… -no cash bail, creates an inability to hold repeat offenders of all types of crimes -“defund the police” - and the overall reduction in DCs police force by over 40%

The problem is, these are liberal policies. Well intentioned ones. I’m a city that is entirely liberal no one is willing to question these policies and their impact. Add on top of it anyone who is upset at the rampant and increases levels of major crime being called a racist, here we are. It’s unfortunate because the city and its government should have a very clear mandate; make DC the best possible city to live in, work in and travel to. Instead the electorate and government are focused on “social justice”, “equity” and work values at any cost. It’s destroying itself and the numbers are evident. Homicides up 200% over 10 years. Population decline. Lowest return to office of any major city. People will point to other cities with the same problems and ignore that they all have democratic leaders instituting the same policies.

This is one of the more cogent responses on the thread, and I’m a democrat like most residents here.

It’s why Biden came out publicly distancing himself from any mention of Defund etc and the far left got their panties in a wad.

It’s why SF (more progressive than DC) recalled their prosecutor.

It’s why NYC elected a former cop (who’s sadly a whack job, but I digress.)

Yet many will skim over anything that’s remotely critical of democrats, in an us vs them tug of war, avoiding a rational policy discussion on high minded ideas vs their actual outcomes, and instead use unproductive populist sound bites like “it was worse in the 80s” or “transplants don’t know the real dc”

In the present moment we know that higher rates of incarceration do not deter crime. In the face of this well established knowledge, the suggestion that we aren't jailing enough young people is hard to read as anything but absurd.

We also know that police pressure on gray markets, the markets themselves largely being responses to specific communities' economic instability and lack of resource access, heightens community instability and can lead to increases in people turning to more violent crime (this is from NYPD's own research of the last 10 years).

If we understand what the drug boom of the 80's was (the sudden appearance of low-barrier-to-entry illegal business in the shift in how cocaine was sold) and how the harshness of the War on Drugs policies actually hardened criminal organization, the claim that softening our approach to marijuana has made DC into some violent crime capital seems dubious at best. This goes doubly when the DoJ's own reports show that the legalization of recreational marijuana do not create "drug" capitals like /u/colby_bartlett is suggesting. The biggest crime increase with marijuana legalization is drunk driving (or drugged driving if you want to be specific).

As far as statistics go, /u/colby_bartlett has some stuff mixed around. DC has not had a population decline. It has has a mild decline in population growth in the past couple years, but the actual population number over time is pretty much a straight line, tilting up. Violent crime rates have overall, consistently gone down. Murder rates have vacillated, dipping in the early teens, with high points at both the present moment and in the 2000s. I think it would be between dubious and bad faith to claim that lower return to office is a result of crime. If anything, it's about people having access to control over their jobs in this city.

In response to your own arguments, it's pretty easy to point out the political grip that police and police unions have over politicians and the media. I mean, look at Bowser. In the lead up to the increase in violence, we have seen her consistently increasing the police budget. How does that increase jibe with increases in crime when you are claiming that policies have been too liberal or progressive?

It seems unfair to say that someone like /u/NorseTikiBar is cherry picking when the whole basis of you two's arguments are doing some strange things with even the basic numbers.

It's really not, given the fact that you have to be born yesterday to think that DC's ballot initiative in 2014 somehow turned DC into the "region's drug center."

Like, I know that some of yall just hate to hear about the 80's and 90's, but maybe it's worth remembering what kind of epidemic the city was facing at that time.

It’s because it’s not what we (me and i assume a lot of other people) want to read on this sub day in and day out. Go on Nextdoor if you want to talk about crime. They love talking about it there and it’s neighborhood specific so you can get more relevant and timely information. This topic has been discussed to death here. It’s exhausting and honestly triggering.

If you want to talk about crime here, then talk about what you’re trying to do to prevent it. Go be a mentor, tutor, community advocate. Donate to youth development programs, support the nonprofits aiming to stop gun violence…. Or channel all your energy into complaining, but do it on Nextdoor, please.

My impression is that a majority of people in the sub do want to be able to discuss crime, but that a vocal minority (including the mods) don't because they think it attracts bad-faith trolls. That may be true, but I don't think a few racist jackasses should mean that we aren't allowed to talk about crime or that discussions about it are strictly limited (as was proposed not too long ago).

While I agree, it is hard to place figures next to someone’s real fear. In other words, crime may have gone down but if someone feels unsafe it’s hard to tell them they should feel a bit better knowing crime really isn’t as bad. I think the issue is that, like with all forms of social media, people are becoming too focused on what bad things are happening and forgetting that there are a lot of good things too. We have to take into account everyone has different levels in which they feel safe but those same people should also recognize that living in a city just demands more vigilance. As a small woman, it sucks to have to walk in the middle of a road, look behind me when I’m walking alone- the list goes on. But crime will always be there and unfortunately we can only adjust to it by being more cautious. We can all continue to be angry about the justice system or lack thereof but until that’s fixed we just all have to change our behavior around crime.

Comments are comparing crine rates to last year. Well, crime is is still indicitive of high crime rates. Whether it's compared to last years, the last ten or 20. Crime is still crime no matter what.

It's pretty fucked that everyone is invlidating OP who has been a victim of several repetitive crimes. Sometimes you need to accept things for face value. Someone tells you they feel less safe, you dont need to steer the conversation towards "last years numbers" Tell it to those who have been murdered or assaulted or robbed, do you think they give a fuck about last years numbers.

Fuck eh, DC folks can be so tonedeaf, not every single thing is about polls and numbers.

This is not inherently true? Crime is not in itself indicative of high crime rates. What is "high" to you? If it is above 0 crime, then perhaps your standards for what "high crime" is are not ones others would agree to?

Someone tells you they feel less safe, you dont need to steer the conversation towards "last years numbers" Tell it to those who have been murdered or assaulted or robbed, do you think they give a fuck about last years numbers.

If crime rates are going down, have you considered that there are less people who are getting murdered or assaulted or robbed? Why don't you ask the people who aren't being robbed if they "give a fuck" about not being robbed? This is a silly conversation.

Because the numbers don't match your feelings. Just because local news fear mongers doesn't mean it's actually worse

DC / Hill East
Welcome to city expect many crime hehe. Better than x years ago!

Fr tho I get that this is a city and all, but I feel like I shouldn’t be hearing about multiple stabbings/shootings at places I frequent (CVS, L’Enfant, etc.). When I’m on the metro or on a run, I have noticed teenage boys trying to intimidate me and other passerbys by making sporadic movements while people are just going about their day. Myself and everyone of course ignores this, but it really gives off Philly vibes lol. No less I’ve almost been mugged over a calzone in broad daylight. Just thankful I’m a dude traversing this city tho. This is all from the last 5 months I’ve had a continued presence here. Many other experiences from weeks and months I’ve spent here in the past decade 🫠

If it's just Philly vibes, then I'm happy to hear it because I'm moving to DC from Philly. Looking forward to new sights and sounds.

Petworth
Maybe it's just me (how I approach living in the city, what I look like (6'1 athletic build), or where I live (Petworth)), but I don't feel like city life has changed all that much in the 20 years I've been here and I rarely experience episodes of feeling unrealistically unsafe or see crime that genuinely concern me. Does that mean I don't hear a gun-shot every once in a while? Do I never see shoplifting, drug usage, or see cars missing tires? No. But I also understand that some level of crime comes with living in a big city with economic diversity. But what I do see, is an unusual amount of people complaining about crime and article written about the issue as well.

Y’all should have seen the crime 30 years ago though.

Well, my point is that things are a lot better now.

Do I ‘prefer’ being mugged over murdered or people strung out everywhere? Yeah, of course. But why is that a choice or should we take that comparison and shrug and not care about what we’re seeing now?

Oh no, I think we should care. I just want any newcomers to have perspective. And to be clear, I don’t know who is or isn’t a newcomer.

Fair enough - I think (to OP’s point) a lot of the conversation around this topic typically devolves because some view the history of DC’s crime and think we are in a much better place, so therefore everything is fine.

I apologize if my response came off curt and I do think it’s great that DC has improved compared to the past. We are just dealing with an uptick relative to a shorter history and that’s what worries people today.

On one hand I don’t want people to lose sight just because it’s better but on the other hand I think some people need perspective. I didn’t take you as curt at all!

That's cool, but how does that help someone feel safe today? Instead of getting mugged once a year back in the old days you got mugged at least once a quarter.

You're probably going to get downvoted just for bringing that up but i was there too. Had a retail job on georgia ave. Rode the 70 bus a lot. Witnessed a murder right in front of us. It was worse back then, or at least it felt like it was worse. Not sure how people receive the older data and statistics (or just stories) going that far back. Maybe it was too long ago to be part of the recent trends and the discussion about what's going on now.
